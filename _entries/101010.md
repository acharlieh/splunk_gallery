To recognize the system administrators who have a tireless, and often thankless job, in 2006 Splunk in conjunction with 6 other co-sponsors created a "Sysadmin of the Year" award.

Announced on [System Administrator Appreciation Day](http://sysadminday.com/), nominees for this award at least were given this t-shirt. 101010 is of course binary for [the answer to life, the universe, and everything.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/42_(number)#The_Hitchhiker.27s_Guide_to_the_Galaxy).
