During an offsite strategy meeting, {% include person.html id="guido" %} emphatically declared that customers wanted a "Single Glass of Pane."

He actually meant "Single Pane of Glass," the holy grail for all "Manager of Managers" (MoM) solutions for enterprise monitoring and management. But those in attendance found the inverted declaration amusing, doubly so due to Guido's strong German accent. As a result these single glasses of pain (shot glasses) were created, and made a fine addition to the Splunk barware collection that started with the {% include entry.html id="drunk" %} series.
