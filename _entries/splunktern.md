This slogan, coined by {% include person.html id="firebus" %} in 2015, is printed on shirts given to those who go through the [splunktern](https://www.splunk.com/en_us/careers/university-recruiting.html) program each year. The corresponding poster of {% include person.html id="swan" %} with a [Pegasus pony](https://mlp.fandom.com/wiki/Rainbow_Dash) perched on top of his middle finger has often been seen plastered around the SF office during the summer internship season.
