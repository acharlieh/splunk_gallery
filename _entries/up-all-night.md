This was a limited run shirt, created by {% include person.html id="piebob" %}. At .conf 2013, these shirts were given to awesome folks who were active in the Answers and IRC communities to recognize their contributions. Unlike other official splunk shirts, this one has a chalkboard on the shirt, so the wearer could write and change what they were up all night to get.
