In the realm of pranks, one time, someone posted signs for a Chewbacca sound alike contest all over the 250 Brannan Street HQ. These fliers promised prizes for the best Wookie [sic] impression, just call the listed number... which happens to be the cell phone of {% include person.html id="amrit" %}. This lead to a number of strange voicemails from other Splunkers, and members of the community.

These posters are still reposted from time to time by an unknown actor, which {% include person.html id="firebus" %} vandalizes in order to <a href="http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Wookiee" _target="_new">correct the spelling</a>.
