In the realm of pranks, one time, someone posted signs for a Chewbacca sound alike contest all over 250 Brannon Street (The original Splunk HQ). These fliers promised prizes for the best wookie impression, just call the listed number... which happened to be the cell phone of {% include person.html id="amrit" %}. This lead to a number of strange voicemails from other Splunkers, and members of the community.
