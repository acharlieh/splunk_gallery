One time at the [San Francisco Splunk User Group](https://usergroups.splunk.com/group/san-francisco-bay-area-splunk-user-group.html), {% include person.html id="lenny" %}, Chief Legal Counsel for Splunk was having a birthday. There was of course cake made with Lenny's face on it, which was consumed, and maybe some sake was involved, but these six inch buttons were subsequently made to commemorate the occasion.
