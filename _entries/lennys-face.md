In March 2016, {% include person.html id="lenny" %}, Chief Legal Counsel for Splunk, was having a birthday. In celebration, cake was brought in for the legal group to enjoy, decorated with Lenny's face. This was slightly problematic, as none of the legal group could bring themselves to eat their boss's picture on the cake. Instead they opted to eat the outside, where his face was not.

The leftover cake was then brought to the [San Francisco Splunk User Group](https://usergroups.splunk.com/group/san-francisco-bay-area-splunk-user-group.html), whose attendees had no such qualms, and proceeded to celebrate, drink, and consume Lenny's face. Possibly due to the sake, {% include person.html id="firebus" %} decided that these six inch buttons were needed to be made to commemorate the occasion.
