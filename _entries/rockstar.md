In 2007, Splunk co-sponsored the second {% include entry.html id="101010" title="Sysadmin of the Year" %} contest, with the theme of "Is your sysadmin a rock star?" 

As part of the contest, {% include person.html id="pmcgovern" %} asked {% include person.html id="maverick" %} to write a song "talking about the wonders of being a sysadmin". It was recorded and provided as a metal hair band rock version (sung by {% include person.html id="ninja" %}), as an unplugged version (sung by Maverick), and without lyrics. Those entering the contest could then create or remix their own song about being a sysadmin. If anything was learned from this contest, it is that sysadmins as a rule should not sing.

The contest shirt has the rock on hand gesture as ascii art composed of binary. Reportedly, the binary reads either "Splunk" or "Splunk Sysadmins Rule All" or something to that effect.

<h3>Lyrics</h3>
    Sysadmin Rockstar  (by Eric “Maverick” Garner)
    Copyright © 2007, Garner. All rights reserved.
     
    I may look like an average guy
    Truth is, I am more than that
    I can cd to your directory
    and quickly read your files with cat
    I can ls your ip address
    and reset your date and time
    I can ps and find your process
    and stop it with a kill -9
     
    Sysadmin Rockstar, I’ve got command-line skillz
    Sysadmin Rockstar, just watching me will give you chills
    Yes it will
     
    I download all the patches and fixes
    and countless system updates
    I push’em out to all the servers
    So nobody escalates
    Never have time to look it up
    I just figure it out as I go
    I’m in the cube next to yours
    But I’m the real one running the show
     
    Sysadmin Rockstar, I’m your IT go-to Guy
    Sysadmin Rockstar, I can hack it on the fly
    Yes I can
    
    (refrain)
    I upgrade all the raids
    I resolve every hairy network issue
    I maintain all the apps and servers
    OSes and the DBs too, yes I do
    Some people say I belong with the geeks
    Others say I belong with the nerds
    But the truth is, I’m one of a kind
    and my actions speak louder than my words
     
    (guitar solo)
    
    Sysadmin Rockstar, I’m your IT go-to guy
    Sysadmin Rockstar, I’ll make it work, do or die
    Sysadmin Rockstar, I take the SH out of IT
    Sysadmin Rockstar, Yeah, that's me
     
    Move over
    Move over
    Move over
    And let me drive
    Move over
    Move over
    Mover over and let me drive for a while
    (repeat chant above and fade out)
