While [Splunk Answers](https://answers.splunk.com) is a great resource for asking ang answering questions about Splunk, like any online forum it is regurily targetted by spammers trying to spread their wares. To help maintain the community against spam, a number of Splunkers, Customers, and Partners have been given moderator privileges on the site, indicated by a diamond ♦ after their user name.

As their first task is to help squash spam, which early on often involved suspending automated spammers from the site, the ♦ was often referred to as [Mjölnir](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mj%C3%B6lnir), or Thor's (Ban-)Hammer.

At .conf18, {% include person.html id="ppablo" %}, gave these inflatable hammers as appreciation to Splunk Answers moderators.
