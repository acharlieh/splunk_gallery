If you go to [.conf](https://conf.splunk.com/), you may see a number of folks running around in capes with the slogan "Splunk> Here to Save the Day". These are the original Splunk Capes... produced by {% include person.html id="piebob" %} to award and recognize awesome members of the community long before the Splunk Trust was created. The original capes tie around the neck, and were created for .conf 2013. At .conf 2014, {% include person.html id="coccyx" %} was giving a segment of the keynote address around how Splunk can make you a superhero. As Clint is also an awesome member of the community, more capes were made and distributed (these ones happen to velcro around the neck and are a slightly different material) and an army of superheroes stood for the conclusion of his segment, to Clint's surprise.

Per [IRC chat logs](https://wiki.splunk.com/Community:IRC) dug out from 30 August 2012, it seems that {% include person.html id="cerby" %} is actually the one who came up with the idea of the cape:
