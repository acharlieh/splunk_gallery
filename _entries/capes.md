If you go to [.conf](https://conf.splunk.com/), you may see a number of folks running around in capes with the slogan "Splunk> Here to Save the Day". These are the original Splunk Capes... produced by {% include person.html id="piebob" %} to award and recognize awesome members of the IRC and Answers [community](https://community.splunk.com) long before the Splunk Trust was created.

The original printing of the capes tie around the neck, and were mailed to community contributors sometime between Holidays 2012 to .conf2013, along with an enclosed card. At .conf2014, {% include person.html id="coccyx" %} was giving a segment of the keynote address around how Splunk can make you a superhero. As Clint is also an awesome member of the community, more capes were made and distributed (these ones happen to velcro around the neck and are a slightly different material) and an army of superheroes stood for the conclusion of his segment, to Clint's surprise.

Independent of these capes, Splunk Field Marketing in the Asia Pacific region made their own capes, albiet using the "{% include entry.html id="ninjas" %}". slogan. Others have made their own unofficial capes to show their Splunk fandom as well.

Per [IRC chat logs](https://wiki.splunk.com/Community:IRC) dug out from 30 August 2012, it seems that {% include person.html id="cerby" %} is actually the one who came up with the idea of the official cape:
