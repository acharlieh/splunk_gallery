Possibly one of the rarest, but most popular Splunk shirts out there. The slogan is a reference to [a popular meme](http://knowyourmeme.com/memes/ermahgerd), and was given out at the party held for awesome [Splunk Answers](https://answers.splunk.com/) and [IRC](https://wiki.splunk.com/Community:IRC) community members during .conf2012. 

This shirt, along with a lot of community schwag, was made by {% include person.html id="piebob" %}. Reportedly, when {% include person.html id="swan" %} saw one he immediately went to find one for himself. The following year, the Splunk community was {% include entry.html id="up-all-night" %}.
