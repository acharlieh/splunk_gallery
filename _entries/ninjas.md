Around 2006 {% include person.html id="ninja" %} was in a “tagline/wallpaper” mood and the [“Ask a Ninja” series](https://www.youtube.com/askaninja) was kinda popular.

He thought that ninjas would be too busy in the assassination business to help you with your IT problems, hence the slogan. After that the Splunk Ninja videos came, a website was born, and even a category of {% include entry.html id="revolution-awards" %} based on that character.

The Asia Pacific region made {% include entry.html id="capes" title="capes" %} using this slogan. The Japan sales team even had Kit Kat bars produced with this slogan and the Splunk logo.
