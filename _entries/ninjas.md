Around 2006 {% include person.html id="ninja" %} was in a “tagline/wallpaper” mood and the [“Ask a Ninja” series](https://www.youtube.com/askaninja) was kinda popular.

He thought that ninjas would be too busy in the assassination business to help you with your IT problems, hence the slogan. After that the Splunk Ninja videos came, a website was born, and even a category of Revolution Awards based on that character.  Go Ninjas!

The Asia Pacific region also made {% include entry.html id="capes" title="capes" %} using this slogan.
