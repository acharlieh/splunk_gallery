This is a one of a kind official shirt, the only shirt slogan created so far by {% include person.html id="godfrey" %}. (A few of his other proposals didn't make it past {% include person.html id="lenny" %}). A play on the classic {% include entry.html id="sh-out-of-it" %}, as well as double entendres on himself and the CEO position. Currently Godfrey is the only one authorized to wear this shirt, and you may catch him wearing it at .conf, but along with the passing of the CEO position, this shirt might be bequeathed to {% include person.html id="doug" %}, if Doug doesn't come up with a shirt of his own.
