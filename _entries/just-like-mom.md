The shirt "Finding your faults, just like mom" slogan was coined by {% include person.html id="carasso" %}. This slogan obviously is referring to a Monitor of Monitors (MoM) architecture that Splunk enables... but also can be taken as a reference to one's mother. David Carasso sent one of the original run of these shirts to his mom, who liked it more *after* finding out he had come up with it.
