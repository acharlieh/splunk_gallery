In early 2018, Splunk acquired [Phantom Cyber Corporation](https://www.phantom.us), a company known for their Security Orchestration, Automation, and Response (SOAR) platform. 

After the acquisition, Phantom could no longer give away their purple shirts, so as a welcome into the Splunk family, they held a competition for a new shirt slogan. Out of a few hundred submissions, this one, coined by {% include person.html id="ybongart" %}, was selected. The (Splunk black) shirts were printed for a limited run and distributed at Black Hat 2018.
