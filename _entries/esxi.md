This slogan was coined by {% include person.html id="irina" %}, around 6 Aug 2013 and was printed and originally handed out at the VMWorld 2013 conference, after [announcing general availability for version 3.0](http://investors.splunk.com/news-releases/news-release-details/splunk-customers-achieve-accelerated-operational-visibility) of the [Splunk App For VMware](https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/725/).
