[General availability for version 3.0](http://investors.splunk.com/news-releases/news-release-details/splunk-customers-achieve-accelerated-operational-visibility) of the [Splunk App For VMware](https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/725/) was a big deal.

This slogan, and "Bringing ESXi back," both referring to the current version of VMWare's Hypervisor were coined by {% include person.html id="irina" %}, and approved by {% include person.html id="ssommer" %} on 6 Aug 2013. Ultimately this slogan won out, and was printed for their debut at the VMWorld 2013 conference.

While this shirt was widely distributed, another slogan, {% include entry.html id="esx" %}, was also approved and printed, but in much smaller quantities.
