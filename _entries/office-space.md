As part of a survey leading up to .conf2017, attendees were asked what do you do after discovering ransomware on your laptop. A fairly significant number choose "Completely and utterly destroy the laptop". So at the end of his section of the keynote {% include person.html id="n8" %}, turned over the laptop to {% include person.html id="bob_deep" %}, {% include person.html id="kelly" %}, and {% include person.html id="amrit" %} to get the job done.

Splunk's media team really did a good job recreating the scene from Office Space. Afterwards, {% include person.html id="n8" %} and {% include person.html id="snooplogg" %} took some of the pieces and set them into resin as mementos. These were then given to a number of the Splunk Trust members during the 2018 Splunk Trust Summit.
