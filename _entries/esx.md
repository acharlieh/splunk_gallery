The [version 3.0 release](http://investors.splunk.com/news-releases/news-release-details/splunk-customers-achieve-accelerated-operational-visibility) of the [Splunk App For VMware](https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/725/) was a big deal. Not only was it a rather large undertaking, but also this became the second paid app from Splunk. (The first of course is [Splunk Enterprise Security](https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/263/)). 

For this event, there needed to be a t-shirt. The first choice for a slogan, now forgotten, was blocked by legal. This slogan, referring to the older version of the VMWare Hypervisor, was coined by {% include person.html id="dzakharov" %} was approved. Later other slogans, including "{% include entry.html id="esxi" %}" were also approved, so it was decided to still print this ESX shirt, but keep it to a much smaller run.
